<h1> My First Project </h1>
<h3> Set of HTML files </h3>
<p>When i was in my 8<sup>th</sup> class (2014)  , i got exposure to HTML . Me and my friend got an opportunity to show this new learning.
Our English teacher asked us to make a PPT on "Voices". We decided to make html files for this ,resulted  these set of files.</p>
<p><b>Git</b> is a great tool for mantaining versions of projects . My old pc (32-bit , win 7) is dying , so i decided to put it here to give it a new life and preserving my old memories .</p>
