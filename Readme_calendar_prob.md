<h1><u> Calendar Problem </u></h1>
<p>This python file computes <b>day</b> on a given <b>date</b> . It is an intresting problem . 
For instance if i ask you day on 26/01/1950 then you may baffle once but if you just give inputs 1950 1 26 then you will get answer in seconds. 
Have fun and try other dates too..
